# Create variables for each object (Rock, Paper, Scissors). 
# Assign a unique number for variables "rock", "paper", "scissors". 
# Create a method that takes an input of the user and assign it to "player".
# Use a random number generator to select the object for the computer/opponent and assign it to variable "computerOpponent".
# Use conditional statements to compare the two variables in order to determine an outcome.
# If the variables are equal, the game results in a draw. If the variables are different, the program determines the winner. 
# Create a variable to keep the score. First player to reach 2 wins out of 3 tries is the victor. 
# Ask user if they would like to run again.
# Maybe create a UI to display graphics?
